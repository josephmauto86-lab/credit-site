# Images Directory

Add your professional images here:

1. `financial-planning.jpg` - Person with calculator and financial documents (400x300px recommended)
2. `consultation-meeting.jpg` - Professional consulting with clients (400x300px recommended)
3. `professional-finance.jpg` - Financial professional discussing solutions (400x300px recommended)

These images will be used throughout the website to enhance visual appeal and provide context for debt counselling services.

Notes:
- Place the three high-quality images (JPEG or WebP) in this folder using the exact filenames listed above so they are available at `/images/<name>` at runtime.
- The site will gracefully fall back to a lightweight SVG placeholder if an image file is missing or fails to load.
- For best results use optimized images (approx 1200px wide for hero/feature areas) and optionally generate WebP alternatives.

Example (local development):
1. Copy files into `public/images/financial-planning.jpg`, `public/images/consultation-meeting.jpg`, and `public/images/professional-finance.jpg`.
2. Restart the dev server if using Vite to ensure files are picked up.

If you'd like, I can add the three images you attached into this folder for you — tell me which filenames you prefer and I'll add them.
